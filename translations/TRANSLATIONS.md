# Translations

We'd like for the repo to be available in many languages. Here is the process for maintaining translations:

* Please put new translation README files here.
* We'll migrate the existing translations when they are ready.
* All diagrams are maintained in English and will not be translated.
* To start a new translation, please:
  1. Make an issue (for collaboration with other translators)
  2. Make a pull request to collaborate and commit to.
  3. Let us know when it's ready to merge.
