## Aloqa protokollari

Arxitektura uslublari amaliy dasturlash interfeysining (API) turli komponentlari bir-biri bilan qanday o'zaro ta'sir qilishini belgilaydi.Natijada, ular API-larni loyihalash va qurishda standart yondashuvni ta'minlash orqali samaradorlik, ishonchlilik va boshqa tizimlar bilan integratsiya qulayligini ta'minlaydi. Bu erda eng ko'p ishlatiladigan uslublar:

<p>
  <img src="../images/api-architecture-styles.png" style="width: 640px">
</p>

- SOAP:
  
  Yetuk, keng qamrovli, XML-ga asoslangan 
  
  Korporativ ilovalar uchun eng yaxshi

- RESTful:

  Ommabop, amalga oshirish oson, HTTP usullari

  Veb-xizmatlar uchun ideal

- GraphQL:

  So'rov tili, maxsus ma'lumotlarni so'rash

  Tarmoq yukini kamaytiradi, tezroq javob beradi

- gRPC:

  Zamonaviy, yuqori samarali, protokol buferlari

  Mikroservislar arxitekturasi uchun javob beradi

- WebSocket:

  Real-time, bidirectional, persistent connections

  Kam kechikishli ma'lumotlar almashinuvi uchun juda mos keladi

- Webhook:

  Voqealarga asoslangan, HTTP qo'ng'iroqlari, asinxron

  Voqea sodir bo'lganda tizimlarni xabardor qiladi


### REST API va GraphQL

API dizayni haqida gap ketganda, REST va GraphQL har birining kuchli va zaif tomonlari bor.

Quyidagi diagrammada REST va GraphQL o'rtasidagi tezkor taqqoslash ko'rsatilgan.

<p>
  <img src="../images/graphQL.jpg">
</p>

REST

- CRUD operatsiyalari uchun GET, POST, PUT, DELETE kabi standart HTTP usullaridan foydalanadi.
- Alohida xizmatlar/ilovalar o'rtasida oddiy, bir xil interfeyslar kerak bo'lganda yaxshi ishlaydi.
- Keshlash strategiyalarini amalga oshirish oson.
- Salbiy tomoni shundaki, u alohida so'nggi nuqtalardan tegishli ma'lumotlarni yig'ish uchun bir nechta aylanishlarni talab qilishi mumkin.

GraphQL

- Mijozlarga kerakli ma'lumotlarni aniq so'rashlari uchun yagona so'nggi nuqtani taqdim etadi.
- Mijozlar ichki so'rovlarda talab qilinadigan aniq maydonlarni belgilaydi va server faqat shu maydonlarni o'z ichiga olgan optimallashtirilgan foydali yuklarni qaytaradi.
- Ma'lumotlarni o'zgartirish uchun mutatsiyalarni va real vaqtda bildirishnomalar uchun obunalarni qo'llab-quvvatlaydi.
- Bir nechta manbalardan ma'lumotlarni jamlash uchun ajoyib va tez rivojlanayotgan frontend talablari bilan yaxshi ishlaydi.
- Biroq, u murakkablikni mijoz tomoniga o'tkazadi va agar to'g'ri himoyalanmagan bo'lsa, haqoratli so'rovlarga ruxsat berishi mumkin.
- Keshlash strategiyalari RESTga qaraganda murakkabroq bo'lishi mumkin.

REST va GraphQL o'rtasidagi eng yaxshi tanlov dastur va ishlab chiqish guruhining o'ziga xos talablariga bog'liq. GraphQL murakkab yoki tez-tez o'zgaruvchan frontend ehtiyojlari uchun juda mos keladi, REST esa oddiy va izchil shartnomalar afzal ko'rilgan ilovalarga mos keladi.

Hech bir API yondashuvi kumush o'q emas. To'g'ri uslubni tanlash uchun talablar va kelishuvlarni diqqat bilan baholash muhimdir. REST va GraphQL ikkalasi ham ma'lumotlarni oshkor qilish va zamonaviy ilovalarni quvvatlantirish uchun to'g'ri tanlovdir.


### gRPC qanday ishlaydi?

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) "**remote(masofaviy)**" deb nomlanadi, chunki u xizmatlar mikroservis arxitekturasi ostida turli serverlarga o'rnatilganda masofaviy xizmatlar o'rtasida aloqa o'rnatish imkonini beradi. Foydalanuvchi nuqtai nazaridan, u mahalliy funktsiya chaqiruvi kabi ishlaydi.

Quyidagi diagramma **gRPC** uchun umumiy ma'lumotlar oqimini ko'rsatadi.

<p>
  <img src="../images/grpc.jpg">
</p>

1-qadam: REST qo'ng'irog'i mijozdan amalga oshiriladi. So'rovning asosiy qismi odatda JSON formatida bo'ladi.

2-4-qadamlar: Buyurtma xizmati (gRPC mijozi) REST qo'ng'irog'ini qabul qiladi, uni o'zgartiradi va to'lov xizmatiga RPC qo'ng'irog'ini qiladi. gRPC **client stub(mijoz stubi)** ni ikkilik formatga kodlaydi va uni past darajadagi transport qatlamiga yuboradi.

5-qadam: gRPC paketlarni HTTP2 orqali tarmoq orqali yuboradi. Ikkilik kodlash va tarmoqni optimallashtirish tufayli gRPC JSONga qaraganda 5X tezroq deb aytiladi.

6-8-qadamlar: To ªlov xizmati (gRPC serveri) tarmoqdan paketlarni qabul qiladi, ularni dekodlaydi va server ilovasini ishga tushiradi.

9-11-qadamlar: Natija server ilovasidan qaytariladi va kodlanadi va transport qatlamiga yuboriladi.

12-14-qadamlar: Buyurtma xizmati paketlarni qabul qiladi, ularni dekodlaydi va natijani mijoz ilovasiga yuboradi.

### Webhook nima?

Quyidagi diagrammada so'rov va Webhook o'rtasidagi taqqoslash ko'rsatilgan.

<p>
  <img src="../images/webhook.jpeg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>

Faraz qilaylik, biz elektron tijorat veb-saytini ishga tushiramiz. Mijozlar to'lov operatsiyalari uchun to'lov xizmatiga o'tadigan API shlyuzi orqali buyurtma xizmatiga buyurtma yuboradilar. Keyin to'lov xizmati tranzaktsiyalarni bajarish uchun tashqi to'lov xizmati provayderi (PSP) bilan gaplashadi.

Tashqi PSP bilan aloqa qilishning ikki yo'li mavjud.

**1. Short polling(Qisqa ovoz berish)**

To'lov so'rovi PSP ga yuborilgandan so'ng, to'lov xizmati PSP dan to'lov holati haqida so'rashda davom etadi. Bir necha turdan so'ng, PSP nihoyat holatga qaytadi.

Qisqa so'rovning ikkita kamchiligi bor:
* Doimiy ravishda vaziyatni so'rash to'lov xizmatidan resurslarni talab qiladi.
* Tashqi xizmat to'lov xizmati bilan to'g'ridan-to'g'ri bog'lanib, xavfsizlik zaifliklarini yaratadi.

**2. Webhook**

Biz webhukni tashqi xizmatda ro'yxatdan o'tkazishimiz mumkin. Buning ma'nosi: so'rov bo'yicha yangilanishlar mavjud bo'lganda, menga ma'lum bir URL orqali qo'ng'iroq qiling. PSP qayta ishlashni tugatgandan so'ng, to'lov holatini yangilash uchun HTTP so'rovini chaqiradi.

Shu tarzda, dasturlash paradigmasi o'zgartiriladi va to'lov xizmati endi to'lov holatini so'rash uchun resurslarni isrof qilishiga hojat yo'q.

Agar PSP hech qachon qo'ng'iroq qilmasa nima bo'ladi? Biz har soatda to'lov holatini tekshirish uchun uy ishlarini o'rnatishimiz mumkin.

WebhooksWebhuklar ko'pincha teskari API yoki push API deb ataladi, chunki server mijozga HTTP so'rovlarini yuboradi. Webhukdan foydalanishda 3 narsaga e'tibor qaratishimiz kerak:

1. Biz tashqi xizmat qo'ng'iroq qilish uchun tegishli APIni loyihalashimiz kerak.
2. Xavfsizlik nuqtai nazaridan API shlyuzida tegishli qoidalarni o'rnatishimiz kerak.
3. Biz tashqi xizmatda to'g'ri URL manzilini ro'yxatdan o'tkazishimiz kerak.

### API ish faoliyatini qanday yaxshilash mumkin?

Quyidagi diagrammada API ish faoliyatini yaxshilash uchun 5 ta umumiy hiyla ko'rsatilgan.

<p>
  <img src="../images/api-performance.jpg">
</p>

Pagination(Sahifalar)

Natijaning o'lchami katta bo'lsa, bu keng tarqalgan optimallashtirishdir. Natijalar xizmatning javob berish qobiliyatini yaxshilash uchun mijozga qaytariladi.

Asynchronous Logging(Asinxron ro'yxatga olish)

Sinxron ro'yxatga olish har bir qo'ng'iroq uchun disk bilan ishlaydi va tizimni sekinlashtirishi mumkin. Asinxron ro'yxatga olish jurnallarni avval qulflanmagan buferga yuboradi va darhol qaytadi. Jurnallar diskka vaqti-vaqti bilan tozalanadi. Bu kiritish-chiqarish xarajatlarini sezilarli darajada kamaytiradi.

Caching(Keshlash)

Biz tez-tez foydalaniladigan ma'lumotlarni keshga saqlashimiz mumkin. Mijoz to'g'ridan-to'g'ri ma'lumotlar bazasiga tashrif buyurish o'rniga, avval keshni so'rashi mumkin. Agar kesh o'tkazib yuborilgan bo'lsa, mijoz ma'lumotlar bazasidan so'rashi mumkin. Redis kabi keshlar ma'lumotlarni xotirada saqlaydi, shuning uchun ma'lumotlarga kirish ma'lumotlar bazasiga qaraganda ancha tezroq.

Payload Compression(Yuk yukini siqish)

So'rovlar va javoblar uzatiladigan ma'lumotlar hajmi ancha kichik bo'lishi uchun gzip va boshqalar yordamida siqilishi mumkin. Bu yuklash va yuklab olishni tezlashtiradi.

Connection Pool(Aloqa hovuzi)

Resurslarga kirishda biz ko'pincha ma'lumotlar bazasidan ma'lumotlarni yuklashimiz kerak. Yopuvchi db ulanishlarini ochish sezilarli yukni oshiradi. Shunday qilib, biz DB ga ochiq ulanishlar hovuzi orqali ulanishimiz kerak. Ulanish havzasi ulanishning hayot aylanishini boshqarish uchun javobgardir.

### HTTP 1.0 -> HTTP 1.1 -> HTTP 2.0 -> HTTP 3.0 (QUIC)

HTTP ning har bir avlodi qanday muammoni hal qiladi?

Quyidagi diagrammada asosiy xususiyatlar ko'rsatilgan.

<p>
  <img src="../images/http3.jpg" />
</p>

- HTTP 1.0 1996 yilda yakunlangan va to'liq hujjatlashtirilgan. Bitta serverga har bir so'rov alohida TCP ulanishini talab qiladi.

- HTTP 1.1 1997 yilda nashr etilgan. TCP ulanishi qayta foydalanish uchun ochiq qoldirilishi mumkin (doimiy ulanish), lekin bu HOL (yo'nalish boshi(head-of-line)) blokirovkasi muammosini hal qilmaydi. 

  HOL blokirovkasi - brauzerda ruxsat etilgan parallel so'rovlar soni tugaganda, keyingi so'rovlar avvalgilarining bajarilishini kutishlari kerak.

- HTTP 2.0 2015-yilda nashr etilgan. U HOL muammosini so ªrovni multiplekslash orqali hal qiladi, bu esa dastur qatlamida HOL bloklanishini bartaraf qiladi, biroq HOL transport (TCP) qatlamida hali ham mavjud.

  Diagrammada ko'rib turganingizdek, HTTP 2.0 HTTP "oqimlari" tushunchasini taqdim etdi: bir xil TCP ulanishiga turli xil HTTP almashinuvlarini multiplekslash imkonini beruvchi abstraksiya. Har bir oqimni tartibda yuborish shart emas.

- HTTP 3.0 ning birinchi loyihasi 2020-yilda chop etilgan. U HTTP 2.0 ning tavsiya etilgan vorisi hisoblanadi. U asosiy transport protokoli uchun TCP o'rniga QUIC dan foydalanadi, shuning uchun transport qatlamidagi HOL blokirovkasini olib tashlaydi. 

QUIC UDP ga asoslangan. U oqimlarni transport qatlamida birinchi darajali fuqarolar sifatida tanishtiradi. QUIC oqimlari bir xil QUIC ulanishiga ega, shuning uchun yangilarini yaratish uchun qo'shimcha qo'l siqish(handshake) va sekin boshlash(slow start) talab qilinmaydi, lekin QUIC oqimlari mustaqil ravishda yetkazib beriladi, ko'p hollarda bitta oqimga ta'sir qiladigan paket yo'qotilishi boshqalarga ta'sir qilmaydi.

### SOAP va REST va GraphQL va RPC

Quyidagi diagrammada API vaqt jadvali va API uslublarini taqqoslash tasvirlangan.

Vaqt o'tishi bilan turli xil API arxitektura uslublari chiqariladi. Ularning har biri ma'lumotlar almashinuvini standartlashtirishning o'ziga xos naqshlariga ega. 

Diagrammada har bir uslubning foydalanish holatlarini tekshirishingiz mumkin.

<p>
  <img src="../images/SOAP vs REST vs GraphQL vs RPC.jpeg" />
</p>


### Code First va API First 

Quyidagi diagrammada birinchi kodni ishlab chiqish va API-birinchi ishlanma o'rtasidagi farqlar ko'rsatilgan. Nima uchun biz API birinchi dizaynini ko'rib chiqmoqchimiz?

<p>
  <img src="../images/api_first.jpg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>


- Mikroservislar tizimning murakkabligini oshiradi va bizda tizimning turli funktsiyalarini bajarish uchun alohida xizmatlar mavjud. Ushbu turdagi arxitektura vazifalarni ajratish va ajratishni osonlashtirsa-da, biz xizmatlar o'rtasidagi turli xil aloqalarni boshqarishimiz kerak. 

Kodni yozishdan va xizmatlar chegaralarini sinchkovlik bilan belgilashdan oldin tizimning murakkabligini o'ylab ko'rgan ma'qul.

- Alohida funktsional guruhlar bir xil tilda gapirishlari kerak va maxsus funktsional guruhlar faqat o'zlarining tarkibiy qismlari va xizmatlari uchun javobgardir. Tashkilotga API dizayni orqali bir xil tilda gapirish tavsiya etiladi. 

Kod yozishdan oldin API dizaynini tasdiqlash uchun so'rovlar va javoblarni masxara qilishimiz mumkin.

- Dasturiy ta'minot sifati va ishlab chiquvchining mahsuldorligini oshirish Loyiha boshlanganda noaniqliklarning ko'pini bartaraf etganimiz sababli, umumiy ishlab chiqish jarayoni yanada silliqlashadi va dasturiy ta'minot sifati sezilarli darajada yaxshilanadi.

Ishlab chiquvchilar ham jarayondan xursandlar, chunki ular to'satdan o'zgarishlarni muhokama qilish o'rniga funktsional rivojlanishga e'tibor berishlari mumkin.

Loyihaning hayotiy tsiklining oxiriga kelib kutilmagan hodisalar bo'lish ehtimoli kamayadi.

Biz APIni birinchi bo'lib ishlab chiqqanimiz sababli, testlar kod ishlab chiqilayotganda ishlab chiqilishi mumkin. Qaysidir ma'noda, API birinchi ishlanmasidan foydalanganda bizda TDD (Test Driven Design) mavjud.

### HTTP holat kodlari

<p>
  <img src="../images/http-status-code.jpg" style="width: 540px" />
</p>


HTTP uchun javob kodlari besh toifaga bo'lingan:

Informational (100-199) \
Success (200-299) \
Redirection (300-399) \
Client Error (400-499) \
Server Error (500-599) 

### API shlyuzi nima qiladi?

Quyidagi diagrammada tafsilotlar ko'rsatilgan. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/api_gateway.jpg" style="width: 520px" />
</p>

1-qadam - mijoz API shlyuziga HTTP so'rovini yuboradi.

2-qadam - API shlyuzi HTTP so'rovidagi atributlarni tahlil qiladi va tasdiqlaydi.

3-qadam - API shlyuzi ruxsat-ro ªyxat/rad etish ro ªyxatini tekshirishni amalga oshiradi.

4-qadam - API shlyuzi autentifikatsiya va avtorizatsiya uchun identifikatsiya provayderi bilan gaplashadi.

5-qadam - so'rovga tarifni cheklash qoidalari qo'llaniladi. Agar limitdan oshib ketgan bo'lsa, so'rov rad etiladi.

6 va 7-qadamlar - Endi so'rov asosiy tekshiruvlardan o'tgan bo'lsa, API shlyuzi mos keladigan yo'nalish bo'yicha yo'nalish uchun tegishli xizmatni topadi.

8-qadam - API shlyuzi so'rovni tegishli protokolga o'zgartiradi va uni backend mikroservislariga yuboradi. 

9-12-qadamlar: API shlyuzi xatolarni to'g'ri boshqarishi mumkin va agar xatoni tiklash uchun ko'proq vaqt kerak bo'lsa, xatolar bilan shug'ullanadi (elektron uzilish). Shuningdek, u ro'yxatga olish va monitoring qilish uchun ELK (Elastic-Logstash-Kibana) stekidan foydalanishi mumkin. Biz ba'zan ma'lumotlarni API shlyuzida keshlaymiz. 

### Qanday qilib samarali va xavfsiz API-larni loyihalashtiramiz?

Quyidagi diagrammada xarid savatchasi misoli bilan odatiy API dizaynlari ko'rsatilgan.

<p>
  <img src="../images/safe-apis.jpg" />
</p>


E'tibor bering, API dizayni shunchaki URL yo'l dizayni emas. Ko'pincha biz to'g'ri manba nomlarini, identifikatorlarni va yo'l naqshlarini tanlashimiz kerak. Tegishli HTTP sarlavhalari maydonlarini loyihalash yoki API shlyuzida samarali tezlikni cheklovchi qoidalarni ishlab chiqish bir xil darajada muhimdir. 

### TCP/IP inkapsulyatsiyasi

Ma'lumotlar tarmoq orqali qanday uzatiladi? Nima uchun bizga OSI modelida juda ko'p qatlamlar kerak?

<p>
  <img src="../images/osi model.jpeg" />
</p>

Quyidagi diagrammada tarmoq orqali uzatishda ma'lumotlarning qanday inkapsullanganligi va inkapsulatsiyasi ko'rsatilgan.

1-qadam: A qurilmasi HTTP protokoli orqali tarmoq orqali B qurilmaga ma'lumotlarni yuborganda, u birinchi navbatda dastur sathida HTTP sarlavhasi qo'shiladi.

2-qadam: Keyin ma'lumotlarga TCP yoki UDP sarlavhasi qo'shiladi. U transport qatlamida TCP segmentlariga inkapsullangan. Sarlavhada manba porti, maqsad porti va tartib raqami mavjud.

3-qadam: Keyin segmentlar tarmoq sathida IP sarlavhasi bilan qoplangan. IP sarlavhasi manba/maqsad IP manzillarini o'z ichiga oladi.

4-qadam: IP-datagramma manba/maqsad MAC manzillari bilan ma'lumotlar havolasi qatlamiga MAC sarlavhasi qo'shiladi.

5-qadam: Inkapsullangan ramkalar jismoniy qatlamga yuboriladi va tarmoq orqali ikkilik bitlarda yuboriladi.

6-10-qadamlar: B qurilmasi tarmoqdan bitlarni qabul qilganda, u inkapsulyatsiya jarayonining teskari ishlovi bo'lgan de-kapsulyatsiya jarayonini amalga oshiradi. Sarlavhalar qavatma-qavat o'chiriladi va oxir-oqibat B qurilmasi ma'lumotlarni o'qiy oladi.

Tarmoq modelida qatlamlar kerak, chunki har bir qatlam o'z mas'uliyatiga e'tibor qaratadi. Har bir qatlam ko'rsatmalarni qayta ishlash uchun sarlavhalarga tayanishi mumkin va oxirgi qatlamdagi ma'lumotlarning ma'nosini bilish shart emas.

### Nima uchun Nginx "teskari" proksi-server deb ataladi?

Quyidagi diagrammada ùêüùê®ùê´ùê∞ùêöùê´ùêù ùê©ùê´ùê®ùê±ùê≤ va ùê´ùêûùêØùêûùê´ùê¨ùêû ùê©ùê±ùê® o ªrtasidagi farqlar ko ªrsatilgan.

<p>
  <img src="../images/Forward Proxy v.s. Reverse Proxy2x.jpg" style="width: 720px" />
</p>

Oldinga proksi-server foydalanuvchi qurilmalari va internet o'rtasida joylashgan serverdir.

Proksi-server odatda quyidagilar uchun ishlatiladi:

1. Mijozlarni himoya qilish
2. Ko'rib chiqish cheklovlarini chetlab o'tish
3. Muayyan tarkibga kirishni bloklash

Teskari proksi-server mijozning so'rovini qabul qiladigan, so'rovni veb-serverlarga yo'naltiradigan va proksi-server so'rovni qayta ishlagandek natijalarni mijozga qaytaradigan serverdir.

Teskari proksi-server quyidagilar uchun mos keladi:

1. Serverlarni himoya qilish
2. Yukni muvozanatlash
3. Statik tarkibni keshlash
4. SSL aloqalarini shifrlash va shifrini ochish

### Umumiy yuklarni muvozanatlash algoritmlari qanday?

Quyidagi diagrammada 6 ta umumiy algoritm ko'rsatilgan.

<p>
  <img src="../images/lb-algorithms.jpg" />
</p>

- Statik Algoritmlar 

1. Aylanma o'yin(Round robin)

    Mijoz so'rovlari turli xil xizmat ko'rsatish instantsiyalariga ketma-ket tartibda yuboriladi. Xizmatlar odatda fuqaroligi bo'lmagan bo'lishi kerak.

2. Yopishqoq aylanma-robin (Sticky round-robin)

    Bu round-robin algoritmini takomillashtirishdir. Agar Elisning birinchi so'rovi A xizmatiga kirsa, keyingi so'rovlar ham A xizmatiga o'tadi. 

3. Og'irlangan aylanma-robin (Weighted round-robin)

    Administrator har bir xizmat uchun vaznni belgilashi mumkin. Og'irligi yuqori bo'lganlar boshqalarga qaraganda ko'proq so'rovlarni qabul qilishadi. 

4. Hesh

    Ushbu algoritm kiruvchi so'rovlarning IP yoki URL manzilida xesh funktsiyasini qo'llaydi. So'rovlar xesh funksiyasi natijasi asosida tegishli instansiyalarga yo'naltiriladi. 

- Dinamik Algoritmlar

5. Eng kam ulanishlar

    Eng kam parallel ulanishlar bilan xizmat ko'rsatish instantsiyasiga yangi so'rov yuboriladi. 

6. Eng kam javob vaqti

    Yangi so'rov eng tez javob vaqti bilan xizmat instantsiyasiga yuboriladi.

### URL, URI, URN - Farqlarni bilasizmi?

Quyidagi diagrammada URL, URI va URN solishtirish ko'rsatilgan. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/url-uri-urn.jpg" />
</p>

- URI 

URI yagona resurs identifikatorini (Uniform Resource Identifier) anglatadi. U internetdagi mantiqiy yoki jismoniy manbani aniqlaydi. URL va URN URI ning pastki turlaridir. URL manbani aniqlaydi, URN esa resurs nomini beradi.

URI quyidagi qismlardan iborat: 
scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment] 

- URL 

URL HTTP ning asosiy tushunchasi bo'lgan Yagona Resurs Locator (Uniform Resource Locator) degan ma'noni anglatadi. Bu internetdagi noyob manbaning manzili. U FTP va JDBC kabi boshqa protokollar bilan ishlatilishi mumkin. 

- URN 

URN yagona manba nomini (Uniform Resource Name) anglatadi. U urn sxemasidan foydalanadi. Resursni topish uchun URN-lardan foydalanib bo'lmaydi. Diagrammada keltirilgan oddiy misol nomlar maydoni va nomlar maydoniga xos qatordan iborat.

Agar siz ushbu mavzu bo'yicha batafsil ma'lumot olishni istasangiz, men [W3C'ning tushuntirishini](https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/) tavsiya qilaman. 

## CI/CD

### CI/CD Pipeline Explained in Simple Terms

<p>
  <img src="../images/ci-cd-pipeline.jpg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>

Section 1 - SDLC with CI/CD

The software development life cycle (SDLC) consists of several key stages: development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. CI/CD automates and integrates these stages to enable faster and more reliable releases.

When code is pushed to a git repository, it triggers an automated build and test process. End-to-end (e2e) test cases are run to validate the code. If tests pass, the code can be automatically deployed to staging/production. If issues are found, the code is sent back to development for bug fixing. This automation provides fast feedback to developers and reduces the risk of bugs in production.

Section 2 - Difference between CI and CD

Continuous Integration (CI) automates the build, test, and merge process. It runs tests whenever code is committed to detect integration issues early. This encourages frequent code commits and rapid feedback.

Continuous Delivery (CD) automates release processes like infrastructure changes and deployment. It ensures software can be released reliably at any time through automated workflows. CD may also automate the manual testing and approval steps required before production deployment.

Section 3 - CI/CD Pipeline

A typical CI/CD pipeline has several connected stages:
- The developer commits code changes to the source control
- CI server detects changes and triggers the build
- Code is compiled, and tested (unit, integration tests)
- Test results reported to the developer
- On success, artifacts are deployed to staging environments
- Further testing may be done on staging before release
- CD system deploys approved changes to production

### Netflix Tech Stack (CI/CD Pipeline)

<p>
  <img src="../images/netflix-ci-cd.jpg" style="width: 720px" />
</p>

Planning: Netflix Engineering uses JIRA for planning and Confluence for documentation. 

Coding: Java is the primary programming language for the backend service, while other languages are used for different use cases.  

Build: Gradle is mainly used for building, and Gradle plugins are built to support various use cases.  

Packaging: Package and dependencies are packed into an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for release. 

Testing: Testing emphasizes the production culture's focus on building chaos tools.  

Deployment: Netflix uses its self-built Spinnaker for canary rollout deployment.  

Monitoring: The monitoring metrics are centralized in Atlas, and Kayenta is used to detect anomalies.  

Incident report: Incidents are dispatched according to priority, and PagerDuty is used for incident handling. 

## Architecture patterns

### MVC, MVP, MVVM, MVVM-C, and VIPER
These architecture patterns are among the most commonly used in app development, whether on iOS or Android platforms. Developers have introduced them to overcome the limitations of earlier patterns. So, how do they differ? 

<p>
  <img src="../images/client arch patterns.png" style="width: 720px" />
</p>

- MVC, the oldest pattern, dates back almost 50 years 
- Every pattern has a "view" (V) responsible for displaying content and receiving user input 
- Most patterns include a "model" (M) to manage business data 
- "Controller," "presenter," and "view-model" are translators that mediate between the view and the model ("entity" in the VIPER pattern)

### 18 Key Design Patterns Every Developer Should Know

Patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems, resulting in a smoother, more efficient development process. They serve as blueprints for building better software structures. These are some of the most popular patterns: 

<p>
  <img src="../images/18-oo-patterns.png" />
</p>

- Abstract Factory: Family Creator - Makes groups of related items. 
- Builder: Lego Master - Builds objects step by step, keeping creation and appearance separate. 
- Prototype: Clone Maker - Creates copies of fully prepared examples. 
- Singleton: One and Only - A special class with just one instance. 
- Adapter: Universal Plug - Connects things with different interfaces. 
- Bridge: Function Connector - Links how an object works to what it does. 
- Composite: Tree Builder - Forms tree-like structures of simple and complex parts. 
- Decorator: Customizer - Adds features to objects without changing their core. 
- Facade: One-Stop-Shop - Represents a whole system with a single, simplified interface. 
- Flyweight: Space Saver - Shares small, reusable items efficiently. 
- Proxy: Stand-In Actor - Represents another object, controlling access or actions. 
- Chain of Responsibility: Request Relay - Passes a request through a chain of objects until handled. 
- Command: Task Wrapper - Turns a request into an object, ready for action. 
- Iterator: Collection Explorer - Accesses elements in a collection one by one. 
- Mediator: Communication Hub - Simplifies interactions between different classes. 
- Memento: Time Capsule - Captures and restores an object's state. 
- Observer: News Broadcaster - Notifies classes about changes in other objects. 
- Visitor: Skillful Guest - Adds new operations to a class without altering it.

## Database

### A nice cheat sheet of different databases in cloud services

<p>
  <img src="../images/cloud-dbs2.png" />
</p>

Choosing the right database for your project is a complex task. Many database options, each suited to distinct use cases, can quickly lead to decision fatigue. 

We hope this cheat sheet provides high-level direction to pinpoint the right service that aligns with your project's needs and avoid potential pitfalls. 

Note: Google has limited documentation for their database use cases. Even though we did our best to look at what was available and arrived at the best option, some of the entries may need to be more accurate. 

### 8 Data Structures That Power Your Databases

The answer will vary depending on your use case. Data can be indexed in memory or on disk. Similarly, data formats vary, such as numbers, strings, geographic coordinates, etc. The system might be write-heavy or read-heavy. All of these factors affect your choice of database index format. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/8-ds-db.jpg" />
</p>

The following are some of the most popular data structures used for indexing data: 

- Skiplist: a common in-memory index type. Used in Redis 
- Hash index: a very common implementation of the ‚ÄúMap‚Äù data structure (or ‚ÄúCollection‚Äù) 
- SSTable: immutable on-disk ‚ÄúMap‚Äù implementation 
- LSM tree: Skiplist + SSTable. High write throughput 
- B-tree: disk-based solution. Consistent read/write performance 
- Inverted index: used for document indexing. Used in Lucene 
- Suffix tree: for string pattern search 
- R-tree: multi-dimension search, such as finding the nearest neighbor 

### How is an SQL statement executed in the database?

The diagram below shows the process. Note that the architectures for different databases are different, the diagram demonstrates some common designs.

<p>
  <img src="../images/sql execution order in db.jpeg" style="width: 580px" />
</p>


Step 1 - A SQL statement is sent to the database via a transport layer protocol (e.g.TCP).

Step 2 - The SQL statement is sent to the command parser, where it goes through syntactic and semantic analysis, and a query tree is generated afterward.

Step 3 - The query tree is sent to the optimizer. The optimizer creates an execution plan. 

Step 4 - The execution plan is sent to the executor. The executor retrieves data from the execution.

Step 5 - Access methods provide the data fetching logic required for execution, retrieving data from the storage engine. 

Step 6 - Access methods decide whether the SQL statement is read-only. If the query is read-only (SELECT statement), it is passed to the buffer manager for further processing. The buffer manager looks for the data in the cache or data files.

Step 7 - If the statement is an UPDATE or INSERT, it is passed to the transaction manager for further processing.

Step 8 - During a transaction, the data is in lock mode. This is guaranteed by the lock manager. It also ensures the transaction‚Äôs ACID properties. 

###  CAP theorem

The CAP theorem is one of the most famous terms in computer science, but I bet different developers have different understandings. Let‚Äôs examine what it is and why it can be confusing. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/cap theorem.jpeg" />
</p>

CAP theorem states that a distributed system can't provide more than two of these three guarantees simultaneously.

**Consistency**: consistency means all clients see the same data at the same time no matter which node they connect to.

**Availability**: availability means any client that requests data gets a response even if some of the nodes are down.

**Partition Tolerance**: a partition indicates a communication break between two nodes. Partition tolerance means the system continues to operate despite network partitions. 

The ‚Äú2 of 3‚Äù formulation can be useful, **but this simplification could be misleading**.

1. Picking a database is not easy. Justifying our choice purely based on the CAP theorem is not enough. For example, companies don't choose Cassandra for chat applications simply because it is an AP system. There is a list of good characteristics that make Cassandra a desirable option for storing chat messages. We need to dig deeper.

2. ‚ÄúCAP prohibits only a tiny part of the design space: perfect availability and consistency in the presence of partitions, which are rare‚Äù. Quoted from the paper: CAP Twelve Years Later: How the ‚ÄúRules‚Äù Have Changed.

3. The theorem is about 100% availability and consistency. A more realistic discussion would be the trade-offs between latency and consistency when there is no network partition. See PACELC theorem for more details.

**Is the CAP theorem actually useful?**

I think it is still useful as it opens our minds to a set of tradeoff discussions, but it is only part of the story. We need to dig deeper when picking the right database.

### Types of Memory and Storage

<p>
  <img src="../images/Types_of_Memory_and_Storage.jpeg" style="width: 420px" />
</p>


### Visualizing a SQL query

<p>
  <img src="../images/sql-execution-order.jpg" style="width: 580px" />
</p>

SQL statements are executed by the database system in several steps, including: 

- Parsing the SQL statement and checking its validity 
- Transforming the SQL into an internal representation, such as relational algebra 
- Optimizing the internal representation and creating an execution plan that utilizes index information 
- Executing the plan and returning the results 

The execution of SQL is highly complex and involves many considerations, such as: 

- The use of indexes and caches 
- The order of table joins 
- Concurrency control 
- Transaction management 

### SQL language 

In 1986, SQL (Structured Query Language) became a standard. Over the next 40 years, it became the dominant language for relational database management systems. Reading the latest standard (ANSI SQL 2016) can be time-consuming. How can I learn it? 

<p>
  <img src="../images/how-to-learn-sql.jpg" />
</p>

There are 5 components of the SQL language: 

- DDL: data definition language, such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP 
- DQL: data query language, such as SELECT 
- DML: data manipulation language, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE 
- DCL: data control language, such as GRANT, REVOKE 
- TCL: transaction control language, such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK 

For a backend engineer, you may need to know most of it. As a data analyst, you may need to have a good understanding of DQL. Select the topics that are most relevant to you. 

## Cache

### Data is cached everywhere

This diagram illustrates where we cache data in a typical architecture.

<p>
  <img src="../images/where do we cache data.jpeg" style="width: 720px" />
</p>


There are **multiple layers** along the flow.

1. Client apps: HTTP responses can be cached by the browser. We request data over HTTP for the first time, and it is returned with an expiry policy in the HTTP header; we request data again, and the client app tries to retrieve the data from the browser cache first.
2. CDN: CDN caches static web resources. The clients can retrieve data from a CDN node nearby.
3. Load Balancer: The load Balancer can cache resources as well.
4. Messaging infra: Message brokers store messages on disk first, and then consumers retrieve them at their own pace. Depending on the retention policy, the data is cached in Kafka clusters for a period of time.
5. Services: There are multiple layers of cache in a service. If the data is not cached in the CPU cache, the service will try to retrieve the data from memory. Sometimes the service has a second-level cache to store data on disk.
6. Distributed Cache: Distributed cache like Redis holds key-value pairs for multiple services in memory. It provides much better read/write performance than the database.
7. Full-text Search: we sometimes need to use full-text searches like Elastic Search for document search or log search. A copy of data is indexed in the search engine as well.
8. Database: Even in the database, we have different levels of caches:
- WAL(Write-ahead Log): data is written to WAL first before building the B tree index
- Bufferpool: A memory area allocated to cache query results
- Materialized View: Pre-compute query results and store them in the database tables for better query performance
- Transaction log: record all the transactions and database updates
- Replication Log: used to record the replication state in a database cluster

### Why is Redis so fast? 

There are 3 main reasons as shown in the diagram below.

<p>
  <img src="../images/why_redis_fast.jpeg" />
</p>


1. Redis is a RAM-based data store. RAM access is at least 1000 times faster than random disk access.
2. Redis leverages IO multiplexing and single-threaded execution loop for execution efficiency.
3. Redis leverages several efficient lower-level data structures.

Question: Another popular in-memory store is Memcached. Do you know the differences between Redis and Memcached?

You might have noticed the style of this diagram is different from my previous posts. Please let me know which one you prefer.

### How can Redis be used?

<p>
  <img src="../images/top-redis-use-cases.jpg" style="width: 520px" />
</p>


There is more to Redis than just caching. 

Redis can be used in a variety of scenarios as shown in the diagram. 

- Session 

  We can use Redis to share user session data among different services. 

- Cache 

  We can use Redis to cache objects or pages, especially for hotspot data. 

- Distributed lock 

  We can use a Redis string to acquire locks among distributed services. 

- Counter 

  We can count how many likes or how many reads for articles. 

- Rate limiter 

  We can apply a rate limiter for certain user IPs. 

- Global ID generator 

  We can use Redis Int for global ID. 

- Shopping cart 

  We can use Redis Hash to represent key-value pairs in a shopping cart. 

- Calculate user retention 

  We can use Bitmap to represent the user login daily and calculate user retention. 

- Message queue 

  We can use List for a message queue. 

- Ranking 

  We can use ZSet to sort the articles. 

### Top caching strategies

Designing large-scale systems usually requires careful consideration of caching. 
Below are five caching strategies that are frequently utilized. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/top_caching_strategy.jpeg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>



## Microservice architecture

### What does a typical microservice architecture look like? 

<p>
  <img src="../images/typical-microservice-arch.jpg" style="width: 520px" />
</p>


The diagram below shows a typical microservice architecture. 

- Load Balancer: This distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend services. 
- CDN (Content Delivery Network): CDN is a group of geographically distributed servers that hold static content for faster delivery. The clients look for content in CDN first, then progress  to backend services.
- API Gateway: This handles incoming requests and routes them to the relevant services. It talks to the identity provider and service discovery.
- Identity Provider: This handles authentication and authorization for users. 
- Service Registry & Discovery: Microservice registration and discovery happen in this component, and the API gateway looks for relevant services in this component to talk to. 
- Management: This component is responsible for monitoring the services.
- Microservices: Microservices are designed and deployed in different domains. Each domain has its own database. The API gateway talks to the microservices via REST API or other protocols, and the microservices within the same domain talk to each other using RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

Benefits of microservices:

- They can be quickly designed, deployed, and horizontally scaled.
- Each domain can be independently maintained by a dedicated team.
- Business requirements can be customized in each domain and better supported, as a result.

### Microservice Best Practices

A picture is worth a thousand words: 9 best practices for developing microservices.

<p>
  <img src="../images/microservice-best-practices.jpeg" />
</p>

 
When we develop microservices, we need to follow the following best practices: 

1. Use separate data storage for each microservice 
2. Keep code at a similar level of maturity 
3. Separate build for each microservice 
4. Assign each microservice with a single responsibility 
5. Deploy into containers 
6. Design stateless services 
7. Adopt domain-driven design
8. Design micro frontend 
9. Orchestrating microservices 

### What tech stack is commonly used for microservices?

Below you will find a diagram showing the microservice tech stack, both for the development phase and for production.

<p>
  <img src="../images/microservice-tech.jpeg" />
</p>


‚ñ∂Ô∏è ùêèùê´ùêû-ùêèùê´ùê®ùêùùêÆùêúùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêß

- Define API - This establishes a contract between frontend and backend. We can use Postman or OpenAPI for this.
- Development - Node.js or react is popular for frontend development, and java/python/go for backend development. Also, we need to change the configurations in the API gateway according to API definitions.
- Continuous Integration - JUnit and Jenkins for automated testing. The code is packaged into a Docker image and deployed as microservices.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è ùêèùê´ùê®ùêùùêÆùêúùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêß

- NGinx is a common choice for load balancers. Cloudflare provides CDN (Content Delivery Network). 
- API Gateway - We can use spring boot for the gateway, and use Eureka/Zookeeper for service discovery.
- The microservices are deployed on clouds. We have options among AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google GCP.
Cache and Full-text Search - Redis is a common choice for caching key-value pairs. Elasticsearch is used for full-text search.
- Communications - For services to talk to each other, we can use messaging infra Kafka or RPC.
- Persistence - We can use MySQL or PostgreSQL for a relational database, and Amazon S3 for object store. We can also use Cassandra for the wide-column store if necessary.
- Management & Monitoring - To manage so many microservices, the common Ops tools include Prometheus, Elastic Stack, and Kubernetes.

### Why is Kafka fast

There are many design decisions that contributed to Kafka‚Äôs performance. In this post, we‚Äôll focus on two. We think these two carried the most weight.

<p>
  <img src="../images/why_is_kafka_fast.jpeg" />
</p>

1. The first one is Kafka‚Äôs reliance on Sequential I/O.
2. The second design choice that gives Kafka its performance advantage is its focus on efficiency: zero copy principle.
 
The diagram illustrates how the data is transmitted between producer and consumer, and what zero-copy means.
 
- Step 1.1 - 1.3: Producer writes data to the disk 
- Step 2: Consumer reads data without zero-copy

2.1 The data is loaded from disk to OS cache

2.2 The data is copied from OS cache to Kafka application

2.3 Kafka application copies the data into the socket buffer 

2.4 The data is copied from socket buffer to network card

2.5 The network card sends data out to the consumer

 
- Step 3: Consumer reads data with zero-copy

3.1: The data is loaded from disk to OS cache
3.2 OS cache directly copies the data to the network card via sendfile() command
3.3 The network card sends data out to the consumer
 
Zero copy is a shortcut to save the multiple data copies between application context and kernel context.

## Payment systems

### How to learn payment systems?

<p>
  <img src="../images/learn-payments.jpg" />
</p>

###  Why is the credit card called ‚Äúthe most profitable product in banks‚Äù? How does VISA/Mastercard make money? 

The diagram below shows the economics of the credit card payment flow.

<p>
  <img src="../images/how does visa makes money.jpg" style="width: 640px" />
</p>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardholder pays a merchant $100 to buy a product.

2.&nbsp;The merchant benefits from the use of the credit card with higher sales volume and needs to compensate the issuer and the card network for providing the payment service. The acquiring bank sets a fee with the merchant, called the ‚Äúmerchant discount fee.‚Äù

3 - 4. The acquiring bank keeps $0.25 as the acquiring markup, and $1.75 is paid to the issuing bank as the interchange fee. The merchant discount fee should cover the interchange fee. 

  The interchange fee is set by the card network because it is less efficient for each issuing bank to negotiate fees with each merchant.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The card network sets up the network assessments and fees with each bank, which pays the card network for its services every month. For example, VISA charges a 0.11% assessment, plus a $0.0195 usage fee, for every swipe.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardholder pays the issuing bank for its services.

Why should the issuing bank be compensated?

- The issuer pays the merchant even if the cardholder fails to pay the issuer. 
- The issuer pays the merchant before the cardholder pays the issuer.
- The issuer has other operating costs, including managing customer accounts, providing statements, fraud detection, risk management, clearing & settlement, etc. 

### How does VISA work when we swipe a credit card at a merchant‚Äôs shop?

<p>
  <img src="../images/visa_payment.jpeg" />
</p>


VISA, Mastercard, and American Express act as card networks for the clearing and settling of funds. The card acquiring bank and the card issuing bank can be ‚Äì and often are ‚Äì different. If banks were to settle transactions one by one without an intermediary, each bank would have to settle the transactions with all the other banks. This is quite inefficient.   
 
The diagram below shows VISA‚Äôs role in the credit card payment process. There are two flows involved. Authorization flow happens when the customer swipes the credit card. Capture and settlement flow happens when the merchant wants to get the money at the end of the day.
 
- Authorization Flow

Step 0: The card issuing bank issues credit cards to its customers. 
 
Step 1: The cardholder wants to buy a product and swipes the credit card at the Point of Sale (POS) terminal in the merchant‚Äôs shop.
 
Step 2: The POS terminal sends the transaction to the acquiring bank, which has provided the POS terminal.
 
Steps 3 and 4: The acquiring bank sends the transaction to the card network, also called the card scheme. The card network sends the transaction to the issuing bank for approval.
 
Steps 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3: The issuing bank freezes the money if the transaction is approved. The approval or rejection is sent back to the acquirer, as well as the POS terminal. 
 
- Capture and Settlement Flow

Steps 1 and 2: The merchant wants to collect the money at the end of the day, so they hit ‚Äùcapture‚Äù on the POS terminal. The transactions are sent to the acquirer in batch. The acquirer sends the batch file with transactions to the card network.
 
Step 3: The card network performs clearing for the transactions collected from different acquirers, and sends the clearing files to different issuing banks.
 
Step 4: The issuing banks confirm the correctness of the clearing files, and transfer money to the relevant acquiring banks.
 
Step 5: The acquiring bank then transfers money to the merchant‚Äôs bank. 
 
Step 4: The card network clears up the transactions from different acquiring banks. Clearing is a process in which mutual offset transactions are netted, so the number of total transactions is reduced.
 
In the process, the card network takes on the burden of talking to each bank and receives service fees in return.

## DevOps

###  DevOps vs. SRE vs. Platform Engineering. What is the difference?

The concepts of DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering have emerged at different times and have been developed by various individuals and organizations. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/devops-sre-platform.jpg" />
</p>

DevOps as a concept was introduced in 2009 by Patrick Debois and Andrew Shafer at the Agile conference. They sought to bridge the gap between software development and operations by promoting a collaborative culture and shared responsibility for the entire software development lifecycle. 

SRE, or Site Reliability Engineering, was pioneered by Google in the early 2000s to address operational challenges in managing large-scale, complex systems. Google developed SRE practices and tools, such as the Borg cluster management system and the Monarch monitoring system, to improve the reliability and efficiency of their services. 

Platform Engineering is a more recent concept, building on the foundation of SRE engineering. The precise origins of Platform Engineering are less clear, but it is generally understood to be an extension of the DevOps and SRE practices, with a focus on delivering a comprehensive platform for product development that supports the entire business perspective. 

It's worth noting that while these concepts emerged at different times. They are all related to the broader trend of improving collaboration, automation, and efficiency in software development and operations. 

### What is k8s (Kubernetes)?

K8s is a container orchestration system. It is used for container deployment and management. Its design is greatly impacted by Google‚Äôs internal system Borg.

<p>
  <img src="../images/k8s.jpeg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>

A k8s cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers, and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault tolerance and high availability.

- Control Plane Components

1. API Server

    The API server talks to all the components in the k8s cluster. All the operations on pods are executed by talking to the API server.

2. Scheduler

    The scheduler watches pod workloads and assigns loads on newly created pods.

3. Controller Manager

    The controller manager runs the controllers, including Node Controller, Job Controller, EndpointSlice Controller, and ServiceAccount Controller.

4. Etcd
    
    etcd is a key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

- Nodes

1. Pods

    A pod is a group of containers and is the smallest unit that k8s administers. Pods have a single IP address applied to every container within the pod.

2. Kubelet

    An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures containers are running in a Pod.

3. Kube Proxy

    Kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster. It routes traffic coming into a node from the service. It forwards requests for work to the correct containers.

### Docker vs. Kubernetes. Which one should we use? 

<p>
  <img src="../images/docker-vs-k8s.jpg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>


What is Docker ? 

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to package, distribute, and run applications in isolated containers. It focuses on containerization, providing lightweight environments that encapsulate applications and their dependencies. 

What is Kubernetes ? 

Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform. It provides a framework for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. 

How are both different from each other ? 

Docker: Docker operates at the individual container level on a single operating system host. 

You must manually manage each host and setting up networks, security policies, and storage for multiple related containers can be complex. 

Kubernetes: Kubernetes operates at the cluster level. It manages multiple containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing automation for tasks like load balancing, scaling, and ensuring the desired state of applications. 

In short, Docker focuses on containerization and running containers on individual hosts, while Kubernetes specializes in managing and orchestrating containers at scale across a cluster of hosts. 

### How does Docker work? 

The diagram below shows the architecture of Docker and how it works when we run ‚Äúdocker build‚Äù, ‚Äúdocker pull‚Äù 
and ‚Äúdocker run‚Äù. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/docker.jpg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>

There are 3 components in Docker architecture: 

- Docker client 
    
    The docker client talks to the Docker daemon. 

- Docker host 

    The Docker daemon listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. 

- Docker registry 

    A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use. 

Let‚Äôs take the ‚Äúdocker run‚Äù command as an example. 

  1. Docker pulls the image from the registry. 
  1. Docker creates a new container. 
  1. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container. 
  1. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network. 
  1. Docker starts the container.

## GIT

### How Git Commands work

To begin with, it's essential to identify where our code is stored. The common assumption is that there are only two locations - one on a remote server like Github and the other on our local machine. However, this isn't entirely accurate. Git maintains three local storages on our machine, which means that our code can be found in four places: 

<p>
  <img src="../images/git-commands.png" style="width: 600px" />
</p>


- Working directory: where we edit files 
- Staging area: a temporary location where files are kept for the next commit 
- Local repository: contains the code that has been committed 
- Remote repository: the remote server that stores the code 

Most Git commands primarily move files between these four locations. 

### How does Git Work?

The diagram below shows the Git workflow. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/git-workflow.jpeg" style="width: 520px" />
</p>


Git is a distributed version control system. 

Every developer maintains a local copy of the main repository and edits and commits to the local copy. 

The commit is very fast because the operation doesn‚Äôt interact with the remote repository. 

If the remote repository crashes, the files can be recovered from the local repositories. 

### Git merge vs. Git rebase

What are the differences?

<p>
  <img src="../images/git-merge-git-rebase.jpeg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>


When we **merge changes** from one Git branch to another, we can use ‚Äògit merge‚Äô or ‚Äògit rebase‚Äô. The diagram below shows how the two commands work.

**Git merge**

This creates a new commit G‚Äô in the main branch. G‚Äô ties the histories of both main and feature branches.

Git merge is **non-destructive**. Neither the main nor the feature branch is changed.

**Git rebase**

Git rebase moves the feature branch histories to the head of the main branch. It creates new commits E‚Äô, F‚Äô, and G‚Äô for each commit in the feature branch.

The benefit of rebase is that it has a linear **commit history**.

Rebase can be dangerous if ‚Äúthe golden rule of git rebase‚Äù is not followed.

**The Golden Rule of Git Rebase**

Never use it on public branches!

## Cloud Services

### A nice cheat sheet of different cloud services (2023 edition)

<p>
  <img src="../images/cloud-compare.jpg" />
</p>


### What is cloud native?

Below is a diagram showing the evolution of architecture and processes since the 1980s. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/cloud-native.jpeg" style="width: 640px" />
</p>

Organizations can build and run scalable applications on public, private, and hybrid clouds using cloud native technologies. 

This means the applications are designed to leverage cloud features, so they are resilient to load and easy to scale. 

Cloud native includes 4 aspects: 

1. Development process 

    This has progressed from waterfall to agile to DevOps. 

2. Application Architecture 

    The architecture has gone from monolithic to microservices. Each service is designed to be small, adaptive to the limited resources in cloud containers. 

3. Deployment & packaging 

    The applications used to be deployed on physical servers. Then around 2000, the applications that were not sensitive to latency were usually deployed on virtual servers. With cloud native applications, they are packaged into docker images and deployed in containers. 

4. Application infrastructure 

    The applications are massively deployed on cloud infrastructure instead of self-hosted servers.

## Linux

### Linux file system explained

<p>
  <img src="../images/linux-file-systems.jpg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>

The Linux file system used to resemble an unorganized town where individuals constructed their houses wherever they pleased. However, in 1994, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) was introduced to bring order to the Linux file system.

By implementing a standard like the FHS, software can ensure a consistent layout across various Linux distributions. Nonetheless, not all Linux distributions strictly adhere to this standard. They often incorporate their own unique elements or cater to specific requirements.
To become proficient in this standard, you can begin by exploring. Utilize commands such as "cd" for navigation and "ls" for listing directory contents. Imagine the file system as a tree, starting from the root (/). With time, it will become second nature to you, transforming you into a skilled Linux administrator.

### 18 Most-used Linux Commands You Should Know 

Linux commands are instructions for interacting with the operating system. They help manage files, directories, system processes, and many other aspects of the system. You need to become familiar with these commands in order to navigate and maintain Linux-based systems efficiently and effectively. 

This diagram below shows popular Linux commands: 

<p>
  <img src="../images/18 Most-Used Linux Commands You Should Know-01.jpeg" style="width: 680px" />
</p>


- ls - List files and directories 
- cd - Change the current directory 
- mkdir - Create a new directory 
- rm - Remove files or directories 
- cp - Copy files or directories 
- mv - Move or rename files or directories 
- chmod - Change file or directory permissions 
- grep - Search for a pattern in files 
- find - Search for files and directories 
- tar - manipulate tarball archive files 
- vi - Edit files using text editors 
- cat - display the content of files 
- top - Display processes and resource usage 
- ps - Display processes information 
- kill - Terminate a process by sending a signal 
- du - Estimate file space usage 
- ifconfig - Configure network interfaces  
- ping - Test network connectivity between hosts 

## Security

### How does HTTPS work?

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP.) HTTPS transmits encrypted data using Transport Layer Security (TLS.) If the data is hijacked online, all the hijacker gets is binary code. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/https.jpg" />
</p>


How is the data encrypted and decrypted?

Step 1 - The client (browser) and the server establish a TCP connection.

Step 2 - The client sends a ‚Äúclient hello‚Äù to the server. The message contains a set of necessary encryption algorithms (cipher suites) and the latest TLS version it can support. The server responds with a ‚Äúserver hello‚Äù so the browser knows whether it can support the algorithms and TLS version.

The server then sends the SSL certificate to the client. The certificate contains the public key, host name, expiry dates, etc. The client validates the certificate. 

Step 3 - After validating the SSL certificate, the client generates a session key and encrypts it using the public key. The server receives the encrypted session key and decrypts it with the private key. 

Step 4 - Now that both the client and the server hold the same session key (symmetric encryption), the encrypted data is transmitted in a secure bi-directional channel.

Why does HTTPS switch to symmetric encryption during data transmission? There are two main reasons:

1. Security: The asymmetric encryption goes only one way. This means that if the server tries to send the encrypted data back to the client, anyone can decrypt the data using the public key.

2. Server resources: The asymmetric encryption adds quite a lot of mathematical overhead. It is not suitable for data transmissions in long sessions.

### Oauth 2.0 Explained With Simple Terms. 

OAuth 2.0 is a powerful and secure framework that allows different applications to securely interact with each other on behalf of users without sharing sensitive credentials. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/oAuth2.jpg" />
</p>

The entities involved in OAuth are the User, the Server, and the Identity Provider (IDP). 

What Can an OAuth Token Do? 

When you use OAuth, you get an OAuth token that represents your identity and permissions. This token can do a few important things: 

Single Sign-On (SSO): With an OAuth token, you can log into multiple services or apps using just one login, making life easier and safer. 

Authorization Across Systems: The OAuth token allows you to share your authorization or access rights across various systems, so you don't have to log in separately everywhere. 

Accessing User Profile: Apps with an OAuth token can access certain parts of your user profile that you allow, but they won't see everything. 

Remember, OAuth 2.0 is all about keeping you and your data safe while making your online experiences seamless and hassle-free across different applications and services.

### Top 4 Forms of Authentication Mechanisms 

<p>
  <img src="../images/top4-most-used-auth.jpg" />
</p>

1. SSH Keys: 
   
    Cryptographic keys are used to access remote systems and servers securely 

1. OAuth Tokens: 

    Tokens that provide limited access to user data on third-party applications 

1. SSL Certificates: 
  
    Digital certificates ensure secure and encrypted communication between servers and clients 

1. Credentials: 

    User authentication information is used to verify and grant access to various systems and services

### Session, cookie, JWT, token, SSO, and OAuth 2.0 - what are they?

These terms are all related to user identity management. When you log into a website, you declare who you are (identification). Your identity is verified (authentication), and you are granted the necessary permissions (authorization). Many solutions have been proposed in the past, and the list keeps growing.

<p>
  <img src="../images/session.jpeg" />
</p>

From simple to complex, here is my understanding of user identity management:

- WWW-Authenticate is the most basic method. You are asked for the username and password by the browser. As a result of the inability to control the login life cycle, it is seldom used today.

- A finer control over the login life cycle is session-cookie. The server maintains session storage, and the browser keeps the ID of the session. A cookie usually only works with browsers and is not mobile app friendly.

- To address the compatibility issue, the token can be used. The client sends the token to the server, and the server validates the token. The downside is that the token needs to be encrypted and decrypted, which may be time-consuming.

- JWT is a standard way of representing tokens. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Since JWT contains the signature, there is no need to save session information on the server side.

- By using SSO (single sign-on), you can sign on only once and log in to multiple websites. It uses CAS (central authentication service) to maintain cross-site information.

- By using OAuth 2.0, you can authorize one website to access your information on another website.

### How to store passwords safely in the database and how to validate a password? 

<p>
  <img src="../images/salt.jpg" style="width: 720px" />
</p>

 
**Things NOT to do**

- Storing passwords in plain text is not a good idea because anyone with internal access can see them.

- Storing password hashes directly is not sufficient because it is pruned to precomputation attacks, such as rainbow tables. 

- To mitigate precomputation attacks, we salt the passwords. 

**What is salt?**

According to OWASP guidelines, ‚Äúa salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process‚Äù.
 
**How to store a password and salt?**

1. the hash result is unique to each password.
1. The password can be stored in the database using the following format: hash(password + salt).

**How to validate a password?**

To validate a password, it can go through the following process:

1. A client enters the password.
1. The system fetches the corresponding salt from the database.
1. The system appends the salt to the password and hashes it. Let‚Äôs call the hashed value H1.
1. The system compares H1 and H2, where H2 is the hash stored in the database. If they are the same, the password is valid. 

### Explaining JSON Web Token (JWT) to a 10 year old Kid

<p>
  <img src="../images/jwt.jpg" />
</p>

Imagine you have a special box called a JWT. Inside this box, there are three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.

The header is like the label on the outside of the box. It tells us what type of box it is and how it's secured. It's usually written in a format called JSON, which is just a way to organize information using curly braces { } and colons : .

The payload is like the actual message or information you want to send. It could be your name, age, or any other data you want to share. It's also written in JSON format, so it's easy to understand and work with.
Now, the signature is what makes the JWT secure. It's like a special seal that only the sender knows how to create. The signature is created using a secret code, kind of like a password. This signature ensures that nobody can tamper with the contents of the JWT without the sender knowing about it.

When you want to send the JWT to a server, you put the header, payload, and signature inside the box. Then you send it over to the server. The server can easily read the header and payload to understand who you are and what you want to do.

### How does Google Authenticator (or other types of 2-factor authenticators) work?

Google Authenticator is commonly used for logging into our accounts when 2-factor authentication is enabled. How does it guarantee security?
 
Google Authenticator is a software-based authenticator that implements a two-step verification service. The diagram below provides detail. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/google_authenticate.jpeg" />
</p>


There are two stages involved:

- Stage 1 - The user enables Google two-step verification. 
- Stage 2 - The user uses the authenticator for logging in, etc.

Let‚Äôs look at these stages.
 
**Stage 1**

Steps 1 and 2: Bob opens the web page to enable two-step verification. The front end requests a secret key. The authentication service generates the secret key for Bob and stores it in the database.
 
Step 3: The authentication service returns a URI to the front end. The URI is composed of a key issuer, username, and secret key. The URI is displayed in the form of a QR code on the web page.
 
Step 4: Bob then uses Google Authenticator to scan the generated QR code. The secret key is stored in the authenticator.

**Stage 2**
Steps 1 and 2: Bob wants to log into a website with Google two-step verification. For this, he needs the password. Every 30 seconds, Google Authenticator generates a 6-digit password using TOTP (Time-based One Time Password) algorithm. Bob uses the password to enter the website.
 
Steps 3 and 4: The frontend sends the password Bob enters to the backend for authentication. The authentication service reads the secret key from the database and generates a 6-digit password using the same TOTP algorithm as the client.
 
Step 5: The authentication service compares the two passwords generated by the client and the server, and returns the comparison result to the frontend. Bob can proceed with the login process only if the two passwords match.
 
Is this authentication mechanism safe? 

- Can the secret key be obtained by others? 

    We need to make sure the secret key is transmitted using HTTPS. The authenticator client and the database store the secret key, and we need to make sure the secret keys are encrypted.

- Can the 6-digit password be guessed by hackers?
    
    No. The password has 6 digits, so the generated password has 1 million potential combinations. Plus, the password changes every 30 seconds. If hackers want to guess the password in 30 seconds, they need to enter 30,000 combinations per second.

### Evolution of Airbnb‚Äôs microservice architecture over the past 15 years

Airbnb‚Äôs microservice architecture went through 3 main stages. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/airbnb_arch.jpeg" />
</p>


Monolith (2008 - 2017)

Airbnb began as a simple marketplace for hosts and guests. This is built in a Ruby on Rails application - the monolith. 

What‚Äôs the challenge?

- Confusing team ownership + unowned code
- Slow deployment 

Microservices (2017 - 2020)

Microservice aims to solve those challenges. In the microservice architecture, key services include:

- Data fetching service
- Business logic data service
- Write workflow service
- UI aggregation service
- Each service had one owning team

What‚Äôs the challenge?

Hundreds of services and dependencies were difficult for humans to manage.

Micro + macroservices (2020 - present)

This is what Airbnb is working on now. The micro and macroservice hybrid model focuses on the unification of APIs.

### Monorepo vs. Microrepo. 

Which is the best? Why do different companies choose different options? 

<p>
  <img src="../images/monorepo-microrepo.jpg" />
</p>


Monorepo isn't new; Linux and Windows were both created using Monorepo. To improve scalability and build speed, Google developed its internal dedicated toolchain to scale it faster and strict coding quality standards to keep it consistent. 

Amazon and Netflix are major ambassadors of the Microservice philosophy. This approach naturally separates the service code into separate repositories. It scales faster but can lead to governance pain points later on. 

Within Monorepo, each service is a folder, and every folder has a BUILD config and OWNERS permission control. Every service member is responsible for their own folder. 

On the other hand, in Microrepo, each service is responsible for its repository, with the build config and permissions typically set for the entire repository. 

In Monorepo, dependencies are shared across the entire codebase regardless of your business, so when there's a version upgrade, every codebase upgrades their version. 

In Microrepo, dependencies are controlled within each repository. Businesses choose when to upgrade their versions based on their own schedules. 

Monorepo has a standard for check-ins. Google's code review process is famously known for setting a high bar, ensuring a coherent quality standard for Monorepo, regardless of the business. 

Microrepo can either set its own standard or adopt a shared standard by incorporating the best practices. It can scale faster for business, but the code quality might be a bit different. 
Google engineers built Bazel, and Meta built Buck. There are other open-source tools available, including Nix, Lerna, and others. 

Over the years, Microrepo has had more supported tools, including Maven and Gradle for Java, NPM for NodeJS, and CMake for C/C++, among others. 

### How will you design the Stack Overflow website? 

If your answer is on-premise servers and monolith (on the bottom of the following image), you would likely fail the interview, but that's how it is built in reality!

<p>
  <img src="../images/stackoverflow.jpg" />
</p>


**What people think it should look like**

The interviewer is probably expecting something like the top portion of the picture.

- Microservice is used to decompose the system into small components.
- Each service has its own database. Use cache heavily.
- The service is sharded.
- The services talk to each other asynchronously through message queues.
- The service is implemented using Event Sourcing with CQRS.
- Showing off knowledge in distributed systems such as eventual consistency, CAP theorem, etc.

**What it actually is**

Stack Overflow serves all the traffic with only 9 on-premise web servers, and it‚Äôs on monolith! It has its own servers and does not run on the cloud.

This is contrary to all our popular beliefs these days. 

### Why did Amazon Prime Video monitoring move from serverless to monolithic? How can it save 90% cost?

The diagram below shows the architecture comparison before and after the migration. 

<p>
  <img src="../images/serverless-to-monolithic.jpeg" />
</p>


What is Amazon Prime Video Monitoring Service? 

Prime Video service needs to monitor the quality of thousands of live streams. The monitoring tool automatically analyzes the streams in real time and identifies quality issues like block corruption, video freeze, and sync problems. This is an important process for customer satisfaction. 

There are 3 steps: media converter, defect detector, and real-time notification. 

- What is the problem with the old architecture? 

  The old architecture was based on Amazon Lambda, which was good for building services quickly. However, it was not cost-effective when running the architecture at a high scale. The two most expensive operations are: 

1. The orchestration workflow - AWS step functions charge users by state transitions and the orchestration performs multiple state transitions every second. 

2. Data passing between distributed components - the intermediate data is stored in Amazon S3 so that the next stage can download. The download can be costly when the volume is high. 

- Monolithic architecture saves 90% cost 

  A monolithic architecture is designed to address the cost issues. There are still 3 components, but the media converter and defect detector are deployed in the same process, saving the cost of passing data over the network. Surprisingly, this approach to deployment architecture change led to 90% cost savings! 

This is an interesting and unique case study because microservices have become a go-to and fashionable choice in the tech industry. It's good to see that we are having more discussions about evolving the architecture and having more honest discussions about its pros and cons. Decomposing components into distributed microservices comes with a cost. 

- What did Amazon leaders say about this? 
  
  Amazon CTO Werner Vogels: ‚ÄúBuilding **evolvable software systems** is a strategy, not a religion. And revisiting your architecture with an open mind is a must.‚Äù 

Ex Amazon VP Sustainability Adrian Cockcroft: ‚ÄúThe Prime Video team had followed a path I call **Serverless First**‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt advocate **Serverless Only**‚Äù. 

### How does Disney Hotstar capture 5 Billion Emojis during a tournament?

<p>
  <img src="../images/hotstar_emojis.jpeg" style="width: 720px" />
</p>


1. Clients send emojis through standard HTTP requests. You can think of Golang Service as a typical Web Server. Golang is chosen because it supports concurrency well. Threads in Golang are lightweight.

2. Since the write volume is very high, Kafka (message queue) is used as a buffer.

3. Emoji data are aggregated by a streaming processing service called Spark. It aggregates data every 2 seconds, which is configurable. There is a trade-off to be made based on the interval. A shorter interval means emojis are delivered to other clients faster but it also means more computing resources are needed.

4. Aggregated data is written to another Kafka. 

5. The PubSub consumers pull aggregated emoji data from Kafka. 

6. Emojis are delivered to other clients in real-time through the PubSub infrastructure. The PubSub infrastructure is interesting. Hotstar considered the following protocols: Socketio, NATS, MQTT, and gRPC, and settled with MQTT.
 
A similar design is adopted by LinkedIn which streams a million likes/sec.

MongoDB ‚û°Ô∏è Cassandra ‚û°Ô∏è ScyllaDB 

In 2015, the first version of Discord was built on top of a single MongoDB replica. Around Nov 2015, MongoDB stored 100 million messages and the RAM couldn‚Äôt hold the data and index any longer. The latency became unpredictable. Message storage needs to be moved to another database. Cassandra was chosen. 

In 2017, Discord had 12 Cassandra nodes and stored billions of messages. 

At the beginning of 2022, it had 177 nodes with trillions of messages. At this point, latency was unpredictable, and maintenance operations became too expensive to run. 

There are several reasons for the issue: 

- Cassandra uses the LSM tree for the internal data structure. The reads are more expensive than the writes. There can be many concurrent reads on a server with hundreds of users, resulting in hotspots. 
- Maintaining clusters, such as compacting SSTables, impacts performance. 
- Garbage collection pauses would cause significant latency spikes 

ScyllaDB is Cassandra compatible database written in C++. Discord redesigned its architecture to have a monolithic API, a data service written in Rust, and ScyllaDB-based storage. 

The p99 read latency in ScyllaDB is 15ms compared to 40-125ms in Cassandra. The p99 write latency is 5ms compared to 5-70ms in Cassandra. 

### How do video live streamings work on YouTube, TikTok live, or Twitch?
 
Live streaming differs from regular streaming because the video content is sent via the internet in real-time, usually with a latency of just a few seconds.
 
The diagram below explains what happens behind the scenes to make this possible.

Step 1: The raw video data is captured by a microphone and camera. The data is sent to the server side.
 
Step 2: The video data is compressed and encoded. For example, the compressing algorithm separates the background and other video elements. After compression, the video is encoded to standards such as H.264. The size of the video data is much smaller after this step.
 
Step 3: The encoded data is divided into smaller segments, usually seconds in length, so it takes much less time to download or stream.
 
Step 4: The segmented data is sent to the streaming server. The streaming server needs to support different devices and network conditions. This is called ‚ÄòAdaptive Bitrate Streaming.‚Äô This means we need to produce multiple files at different bitrates in steps 2 and 3.
 
Step 5: The live streaming data is pushed to edge servers supported by CDN (Content Delivery Network.) Millions of viewers can watch the video from an edge server nearby. CDN significantly lowers data transmission latency. 
 
Step 6: The viewers‚Äô devices decode and decompress the video data and play the video in a video player.
 
Steps 7 and 8: If the video needs to be stored for replay, the encoded data is sent to a storage server, and viewers can request a replay from it later.
 
Standard protocols for live streaming include:

- RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol): This was originally developed by Macromedia to transmit data between a Flash player and a server. Now it is used for streaming video data over the internet. Note that video conferencing applications like Skype use RTC (Real-Time Communication) protocol for lower latency.
- HLS (HTTP Live Streaming): It requires the H.264 or H.265 encoding. Apple devices accept only HLS format.
- DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP): DASH does not support Apple devices.
- Both HLS and DASH support adaptive bitrate streaming.
