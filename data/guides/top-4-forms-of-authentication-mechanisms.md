## 1. SSH Keys

Cryptographic keys are used to access remote systems and servers securely.

## 2. OAuth Tokens

Tokens that provide limited access to user data on third-party applications.

## 3. SSL Certificates

Digital certificates ensure secure and encrypted communication between servers and clients.

## 4. Credentials

User authentication information is used to verify and grant access to various systems and services.

Over to you: How do you manage those security keys? Is it a good idea to put them in a GitHub repository?
