Do you know those 8 common problems in large-scale production systems and their solutions? Time to test your skills!!

## 1. Read-Heavy System

Use caching to make the reads faster.

## 2. High-Write Traffic

*   Use async workers to process the writes

*   Use databases powered by LSM-Trees

## 3. Single Point of Failure

Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical components like databases.

## 4. High Availability

*   Use load balancing to ensure that requests go to healthy server instances.

*   Use database replication to improve durability and availability.

## 5. High Latency

Use a content delivery network to reduce latency.

## 6. Handling Large Files

Use block storage and object storage to handle large files and complex data.

## 7. Monitoring and Alerting

Use a centralized logging system using something like the ELK stack.

## 8. Slower Database Queries

*   Use proper indexes to optimize queries.

*   Use sharding to scale the database horizontally.
