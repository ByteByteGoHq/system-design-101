Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increased workload without losing performance.

However, we can also look at scalability in terms of the scaling strategy.

Scalability is the systemâ€™s ability to handle an increased workload by repeatedly applying a cost-effective strategy. This means it can be difficult to scale a system beyond a certain point if the scaling strategy is not financially viable.

Three main bottlenecks to scalability are:

1. Centralized components: This can become a single point of failure
2. High Latency Components: These are components that perform time-consuming operations.
3. Tight Coupling: Makes the components difficult to scale

Therefore, to build a scalable system, we should follow the principles of statelessness, loose coupling, and asynchronous processing.

Some common techniques for improving scalability are as follows:

* Load Balancing: Spread requests across multiple servers to prevent a single server from becoming a bottleneck.
* Caching: Store the most commonly request information in memory.
* Event-Driven Processing: Use an async processing approach to process long-running tasks.
* Sharding: Split a large dataset into smaller subsets called shards for horizontal scalability.
