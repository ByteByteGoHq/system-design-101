Check out these 8 tips to boost frontend performance:

* **Compression** Compress files and minimize data size before transmission to reduce network load.

* **Selective Rendering/Windowing** Display only visible elements to optimize rendering performance. For example, in a dynamic list, only render visible items.

* **Modular Architecture with Code Splitting** Split a bigger application bundle into multiple smaller bundles for efficient loading.

* **Priority-Based Loading** Prioritize essential resources and visible (or above-the-fold) content for a better user experience.

* **Pre-loading** Fetch resources in advance before they are requested to improve loading speed.

* **Tree Shaking or Dead Code Removal** Optimize the final JS bundle by removing dead code that will never be used.

* **Pre-fetching** Proactively fetch or cache resources that are likely to be needed soon.

* **Dynamic Imports** Load code modules dynamically based on user actions to optimize the initial loading times.
