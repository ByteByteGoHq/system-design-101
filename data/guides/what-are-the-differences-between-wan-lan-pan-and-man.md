In the world of networking, different types of networks are defined based on their size, range, and purpose. The most common types of networks are WAN (Wide Area Network), MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), LAN (Local Area Network), and PAN (Personal Area Network).

*   **Personal Area Network (PAN)**

    A PAN is a network used for communication among devices close to one person, typically within a range of a few meters.

    Use Cases:

    *   Connecting personal devices like smartphones, tablets, and wearables.
    *   Enabling hands-free communication through Bluetooth headsets.
    *   Synchronizing data between a computer and a smartphone.

*   **Local Area Network (LAN)**

    A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited area such as a home, office, or building.

    Use Cases:

    *   Sharing resources like printers and file servers within an office.
    *   Facilitating communication and collaboration among employees.
    *   Providing internet access within a home or small business.

*   **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

    A MAN covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically spanning a city or a large campus.

    Use Cases:

    *   Connecting multiple campuses of a university.
    *   Providing high-speed internet access across a city.
    *   Linking local government offices within a metropolitan area.

*   **Wide Area Network (WAN)**

    A WAN spans a large geographic area, often a country or continent. The most prominent example of a WAN is the Internet.

    Use Cases:

    *   Connecting branch offices of multinational companies.
    *   Facilitating global communication and data exchange.
    *   Enabling remote access to central resources.
