How did AWS grow from just a few services in 2006 to over 200 fully-featured services? Let's take a look.

Since 2006, it has become a cloud computing leader, offering foundational infrastructure, platforms, and advanced capabilities like serverless computing and AI.

This expansion empowered innovation, allowing complex applications without extensive hardware management. AWS also explored edge and quantum computing, staying at tech's forefront.

This evolution mirrors cloud computing's shift from niche to essential, benefiting global businesses with efficiency and scalability.

Happy to present the curated list of AWS services introduced over the years below.
