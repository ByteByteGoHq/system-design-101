An HTTP server cannot automatically initiate a connection to a browser. As a result, the web browser is the initiator. What should we do next to get real-time updates from the HTTP server?

Both the web browser and the HTTP server could be responsible for this task.

*   **Web browsers do the heavy lifting**: short polling or long polling. With short polling, the browser will retry until it gets the latest data. With long polling, the HTTP server doesnâ€™t return results until new data has arrived.
*   **HTTP server and web browser cooperate**: WebSocket or SSE (server-sent event). In both cases, the HTTP server could directly send the latest data to the browser after the connection is established. The difference is that SSE is uni-directional, so the browser cannot send a new request to the server, while WebSocket is fully-duplex, so the browser can keep sending new requests.
