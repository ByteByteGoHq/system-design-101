How does blockchain change the design of digital wallets? Why do VISA and PayPal invest in blockchains?

## In banking systems

*   Deposit process: Bob goes to Bank of America (BoA) to open an account and deposit $100. A new account B1234 is created in the wallet system for Bob. The cash goes to the bankâ€™s vault and Bobâ€™s wallet now has $100. If Bob wants to use the banking services of Citibank (Citi,) he needs to go through the same process all over again.

*   Transfer process: Bob opens BoAâ€™s App and transfers $50 to Aliceâ€™s account at Citi. The amount is deducted from Bobâ€™s account B1234 and credited to Aliceâ€™s account C512. The actual movement of cash doesnâ€™t happen instantly. It happens after BoA and Citi settle all transactions at end-of-day.

*   Withdrawal process: Bob withdraws his remaining $50 from account B1234. The amount is deducted from B1234, and Bob gets the cash.

## With Blockchains

*   Deposit & Withdraw: Blockchains support cryptocurrencies, with no cash involved. Bob needs to generate an address as the transfer recipient and store the private key in a crypto wallet like Metamask. Then Bob can receive cryptocurrencies.

*   Transfer: Bob opens Metamask and enters Aliceâ€™s address, and sends it 2 ETHs. Then Bob signs the transaction to authorize the transfer with the private key. When this transaction is confirmed on blockchains, Bobâ€™s address has 8 ETHs and Aliceâ€™s address has 101 ETHs.

ðŸ‘‰ Can you spot the differences?

Blockchain is distributed ledger. It provides a unified interface to handle the common operations we perform on wallets. Instead of opening multiple accounts with different banks, we just need to open a single account on blockchains, which is the address.

All transfers are confirmed on blockchains in pseudo real-time, saving us from waiting until end-of-day reconciliations.

With blockchains, we can merge wallet services from different banks into one global service.
