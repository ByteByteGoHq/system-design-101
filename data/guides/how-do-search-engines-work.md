Search engines work through a combination of three core processes:

## Crawling

Search engines use automated programs called "crawlers" to discover and download web pages from the internet. These crawlers start with a list of known web pages (seeds) and follow links on those pages to find new ones, creating a vast network of interconnected content.

## Indexing

The information collected by the crawlers is then analyzed and organized into a massive database called an index. This process involves extracting key elements such as keywords, content type, freshness, language, and other classification signals to understand what each page is about and how relevant it might be to different search queries.

## Serving Search Results

When a user enters a query, the search engine's algorithm sifts through the index to identify the most relevant and helpful pages. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

*   **Query Analysis:** The search engine analyzes the user's query to understand its meaning and intent. This includes identifying keywords, recognizing synonyms, and interpreting context.
*   **Retrieval:** The search engine retrieves relevant pages from its vast index based on the query analysis. This involves matching the query's keywords with the indexed content of web pages.
*   **Ranking:** The retrieved pages are then ranked based on their relevance and other factors.
