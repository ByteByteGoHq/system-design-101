![Visualizing a SQL Query](https://assets.bytebytego.com/diagrams/0114-sql-query-logical-order.png)

SQL statements are executed by the database system in several steps, including:

*   Parsing the SQL statement and checking its validity

*   Transforming the SQL into an internal representation, such as relational algebra

*   Optimizing the internal representation and creating an execution plan that utilizes index information

*   Executing the plan and returning the results
