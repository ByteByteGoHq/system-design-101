Scalability, Availability, Reliability, and Performance. They are the most critical components to crafting successful software systems.

Letâ€™s look at each of them with implementation techniques:

*   **Scalability**

    Scalability ensures that your application can handle more load without compromising performance.

*   **Availability**

    Availability makes sure that your application is always ready to serve the users and downtime is minimal.

*   **Reliability**

    Reliability is about building software that consistently delivers correct results.

*   **Performance**

    Performance is the ability of a system to carry out its tasks at an expected rate under peak load using available resources.
