## Dockerfile

It contains the instructions to build a Docker image by specifying the base image, dependencies, and run command.

## Docker Image

A lightweight, standalone package that includes everything (code, libraries, and dependencies) needed to run your application. Images are built from a Dockerfile and can be versioned.

## Docker Container

A running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, providing a secure and reproducible environment for running your apps.

## Docker Registry

A centralized repository for storing and distributing Docker images. For example, Docker Hub is the default public registry but you can also set up private registries.

## Docker Volumes

A way to persist data generated by containers. Volumes are outside the containerâ€™s file system and can be shared between multiple containers.

## Docker Compose

A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, making it easy to manage the entire stack.

## Docker Networks

Used to enable communication between containers and the host system. Custom networks can isolate containers or enable selective communication.

## Docker CLI

The primary way to interact with Docker, providing commands for building images, running containers, managing volumes, and performing other operations.
