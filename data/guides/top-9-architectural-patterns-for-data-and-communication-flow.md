*   **Peer-to-Peer**

    The Peer-to-Peer pattern involves direct communication between two components without the need for a central coordinator.

*   **API Gateway**

    An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests to the backend services of an application.

*   **Pub-Sub**

    The Pub-Sub pattern decouples the producers of messages (publishers) from the consumers of messages (subscribers) through a message broker.

*   **Request-Response**

    This is one of the most fundamental integration patterns, where a client sends a request to a server and waits for a response.

*   **Event Sourcing**

    Event Sourcing involves storing the state changes of an application as a sequence of events.

*   **ETL**

    ETL is a data integration pattern used to gather data from multiple sources, transform it into a structured format, and load it into a destination database.

*   **Batching**

    Batching involves accumulating data over a period or until a certain threshold is met before processing it as a single group.

*   **Streaming Processing**

    Streaming Processing allows for the continuous ingestion, processing, and analysis of data streams in real-time.

*   **Orchestration**

    Orchestration involves a central coordinator (an orchestrator) managing the interactions between distributed components or services to achieve a workflow or business process.
