    *   The most common API styles are REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSockets
*   **API Authentication**
    *   API Authentication techniques like Basic Auth, Token, JWTs, OAuth, and Session Auth
*   **API Documentation**
    *   A good API is understandable. API Documentation tools like Swagger, Postman, Redoc, and DapperDox make it possible.
*   **API Features**
    *   Key API features include pagination, parameters, idempotency, API versioning, HATEOAS, and content negotiation
*   **API Performance Techniques**
    *   Common API performance techniques are caching, rate limiting, load balancing, pagination, DB indexing, scaling, and performance testing.
*   **API Gateways**
    *   Learn about API Gateways such as Amazon API Gateway, Azure API Services, Kong, Nginx, etc.
*   **API Implementation Frameworks**
    *   The most popular API development frameworks are Node.js, Spring, Flask, Django, and FastAPI
