## 1. API Gateway

The gateway provides a unified entry point for client applications. It handles routing, filtering, and load balancing.

## 2. Service Registry

The service registry contains the details of all the services. The gateway discovers the service using the registry. For example, Consul, Eureka, Zookeeper, etc.

## 3. Service Layer

Each microservice serves a specific business function and can run on multiple instances. These services can be built using frameworks like Spring Boot, NestJS, etc.

## 4. Authorization Server

Used to secure the microservices and manage identity and access control. Tools like Keycloak, Azure AD, and Okta can help over here.

## 5. Data Storage

Databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL can store application data generated by the services.

## 6. Distributed Caching

Caching is a great approach for boosting the application performance. Options include caching solutions like Redis, Couchbase, Memcached, etc.

## 7. Async Microservices Communication

Use platforms such as Kafka and RabbitMQ to support async communication between microservices.

## 8. Metrics Visualization

Microservices can be configured to publish metrics to Prometheus and tools like Grafana can help visualize the metrics.

## 9. Log Aggregation and Visualization

Logs generated by the services are aggregated using Logstash, stored in Elasticsearch, and visualized with Kibana.
