The diagram above shows Web 1.0/Web 2.0/Web 3.0 from a bird's-eye view.

*   Web 1.0 - Read Only

Between 1991 and 2004, the internet was like a **catalog of static pages**. We can browse the content by jumping from one hyperlink to another. It doesn’t provide any interactions with the content.

*   Web 2.0 - Read Write

From 2004 to now, the internet has evolved to have search engines, social media apps, and recommendation algorithms backed apps.

Because the apps digitalize human behaviors and persist user data when users interact with these apps, big companies leverage user data for advertisements, which becomes **one of the main business models** in Web 2.0.

That’s why people say the apps know you better than your friends, family, or even yourself.

*   Web 3.0 - Read Write Own

The idea has been discussed a lot recently due to the development of blockchain and decentralized apps. The creators’ content is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and **owned by the users**.

If apps want to access the data, they need to get **authorization** from the users and **pay** for it.

In Web 3.0, the ownership change may lead to some major innovations.
