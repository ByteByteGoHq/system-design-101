Cookies and sessions are both used to carry user information over HTTP requests, including user login status, user permissions, etc.

## Cookies

Cookies typically have size limits (4KB). They carry small pieces of information and are stored on the usersâ€™ devices. Cookies are sent with each subsequent user request. Users can choose to ban cookies in their browsers.

## Sessions

Unlike cookies, sessions are created and stored on the server side. There is usually a unique session ID generated on the server, which is attached to a specific user session. This session ID is returned to the client side in a cookie. Sessions can hold larger amounts of data. Since the session data is not directly accessed by the client, the session offers more security.
