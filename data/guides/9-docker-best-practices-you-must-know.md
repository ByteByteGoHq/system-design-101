## 1. Use official images

This ensures security, reliability, and regular updates.

## 2. Use a specific image version

The default latest tag is unpredictable and causes unexpected behavior.

## 3. Multi-Stage builds

Reduces final image size by excluding build tools and dependencies.

## 4. Use .dockerignore

Excludes unnecessary files, speeds up builds, and reduces image size.

## 5. Use the least privileged user

Enhances security by limiting container privileges.

## 6. Use environment variables

Increases flexibility and portability across different environments.

## 7. Order matters for caching

Order your steps from least to most frequently changing to optimize caching.

## 8. Label your images

It improves organization and helps with image management.

## 9. Scan images

Find security vulnerabilities before they become bigger problems.
