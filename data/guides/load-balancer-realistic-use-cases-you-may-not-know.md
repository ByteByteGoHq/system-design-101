Load balancers are inherently dynamic and adaptable, designed to efficiently address multiple purposes and use cases in network traffic and server workload management.

Let's explore some of the use cases:

*   **Failure Handling:** Automatically redirects traffic away from malfunctioning elements to maintain continuous service and reduce service interruptions.
*   **Instance Health Checks:** Continuously evaluates the functionality of instances, directing incoming requests exclusively to those that are fully operational and efficient.
*   **Platform Specific Routing:** Routes requests from different device types (like mobiles, desktops) to specialized backend systems, providing customized responses based on platform.
*   **SSL Termination:** Handles the encryption and decryption of SSL traffic, reducing the processing burden on backend infrastructure.
*   **Cross Zone Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming traffic across various geographic or network zones, increasing the system's resilience and capacity for handling large volumes of requests.
*   **User Stickiness:** Maintains user session integrity and tailored user interactions by consistently directing requests from specific users to designated backend servers.
