*   **Domain Model Driven**
    When designing the path structure of a RESTful API, we can refer to the domain model.
*   **Choose Proper HTTP Methods**
    Defining a few basic HTTP Methods can simplify the API design. For example, PATCH can often be a problem for teams.
*   **Implement Idempotence Properly**
    Designing for idempotence in advance can improve the robustness of an API. GET method is idempotent, but POST needs to be designed properly to be idempotent.
*   **Choose Proper HTTP Status Codes**
    Define a limited number of HTTP status codes to use to simplify application development.
*   **Versioning**
    Designing the version number for the API in advance can simplify upgrade work.
*   **Semantic Paths**
    Using semantic paths makes APIs easier to understand, so that users can find the correct APIs in the documentation.
*   **Batch Processing**
    Use batch/bulk as a keyword and place it at the end of the path.
*   **Query Language**
    Designing a set of query rules makes the API more flexible. For example, pagination, sorting, filtering etc.
