By being aware of these anti-patterns and following cloud-native best practices, you can design, build, and operate more robust, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud-native applications.

## Monolithic Architecture

One large, tightly coupled application running on the cloud, hindering scalability and agility.

## Ignoring Cost Optimization

Cloud services can be expensive, and not optimizing costs can result in budget overruns.

## Mutable Infrastructure

*   Infrastructure components are to be treated as disposable and are never modified in place.

*   Failing to embrace this approach can lead to configuration drift, increased maintenance, and decreased reliability.

## Inefficient DB Access Patterns

Use of overly complex queries or lacking database indexing, can lead to performance degradation and database bottlenecks.

## Large Containers or Bloated Images

Creating large containers or using bloated images can increase deployment times, consume more resources, and slow down application scaling.

## Ignoring CI/CD Pipelines

Deployments become manual and error-prone, impeding the speed and frequency of software releases.

## Shared Resources Dependency

Applications relying on shared resources like databases can create contention and bottlenecks, affecting overall performance.

## Using Too Many Cloud Services Without a Strategy

While cloud providers offer a vast array of services, using too many of them without a clear strategy can create complexity and make it harder to manage the application.

## Stateful Components

Relying on persistent state in applications can introduce complexity, hinder scalability, and limit fault tolerance.
