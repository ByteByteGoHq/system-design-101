Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable infrastructure platform with over 200 services in the cloud, powering hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

For both newcomers and seasoned professionals, navigating the broad set of AWS services is no small feat.

From computing power, storage options, and networking capabilities to database management, analytics, and machine learning, AWS provides a wide array of tools that can be daunting to understand and master.

Each service is tailored to specific needs and use cases, requiring a deep understanding of not just the services themselves, but also how they interact and integrate within an IT ecosystem.
