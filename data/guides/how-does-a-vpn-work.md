This diagram below shows how we access the internet with and without VPNs.

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the public internet. The primary purpose of a VPN is to provide privacy and security to data and communications.

A VPN acts as a tunnel through which the encrypted data goes from one location to another. Any external party cannot see the data transferring.

A VPN works in 4 steps:

*   Step 1 - Establish a secure tunnel between our device and the VPN server.

*   Step 2 - Encrypt the data transmitted.

*   Step 3 - Mask our IP address, so it appears as if our internet activity is coming from the VPN server.

*   Step 4 - Our internet traffic is routed through the VPN server.

## Advantages of a VPN:

*   **Privacy**
*   **Anonymity**
*   **Security**
*   **Encryption**
*   **Masking the original IP address**

## Disadvantages of a VPN:

*   **VPN blocking**
*   **Slow down connections**
*   **Trust in VPN provider**
