Patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems, resulting in a smoother, more efficient development process. They serve as blueprints for building better software structures. These are some of the most popular patterns:

*   **Abstract Factory:** Family Creator - Makes groups of related items.

*   **Builder:** Lego Master - Builds objects step by step, keeping creation and appearance separate.

*   **Prototype:** Clone Maker - Creates copies of fully prepared examples.

*   **Singleton:** One and Only - A special class with just one instance.

*   **Adapter:** Universal Plug - Connects things with different interfaces.

*   **Bridge:** Function Connector - Links how an object works to what it does.

*   **Composite:** Tree Builder - Forms tree-like structures of simple and complex parts.

*   **Decorator:** Customizer - Adds features to objects without changing their core.

*   **Facade:** One-Stop-Shop - Represents a whole system with a single, simplified interface.

*   **Flyweight:** Space Saver - Shares small, reusable items efficiently.

*   **Proxy:** Stand-In Actor - Represents another object, controlling access or actions.

*   **Chain of Responsibility:** Request Relay - Passes a request through a chain of objects until handled.

*   **Command:** Task Wrapper - Turns a request into an object, ready for action.

*   **Iterator:** Collection Explorer - Accesses elements in a collection one by one.

*   **Mediator:** Communication Hub - Simplifies interactions between different classes.

*   **Memento:** Time Capsule - Captures and restores an object's state.

*   **Observer:** News Broadcaster - Notifies classes about changes in other objects.

*   **Visitor:** Skillful Guest - Adds new operations to a class without altering it.
