Caching is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it back when requested. When a web server renders a web page, it stores the result of the page rendering in a cache. The next time the web page is requested, the server serves the cached page without re-rendering the page. This process reduces the time needed to generate the web page and reduces the load on the server.
