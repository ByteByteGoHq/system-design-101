Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here are some guidelines to follow when submitting pull requests:

## Pull Requests

* Each pull request should focus on a single topic or concept.
* Avoid making changes across multiple topics in the same PR.
* Give your PR a clear title summarizing the topic you are addressing.
* If you notice typos or issues in diagrams, please open a separate issue instead of fixing the images directly. We will update the source images and republish fixes.
* Please do not use AI tools to generate the content.

### GitHub Pull Requests Docs

If you are not familiar with pull requests, review the [pull request docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Translations

We are not planning to translate the guides into other languages at this time. Feel free to star/watch the repo if you want to get notified for when we do.
