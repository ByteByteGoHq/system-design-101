Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here are some guidelines to follow when submitting pull requests:

## Pull Requests

* Each pull request should focus on a single topic or concept.
* Avoid making changes across multiple topics in the same PR.
* Give your PR a clear title summarizing the topic you are addressing.
* If you notice typos or issues in diagrams, please open a separate issue instead of fixing the images directly. We will update the source images and republish fixes.

### GitHub Pull Requests Docs

If you are not familiar with pull requests, review the [pull request docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
